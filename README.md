The title is initially the folder name. I change this title to *Aria*, which is the short title for the series.

The picture drama episodes [are specials](http://thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=79839&seasonid=27236&lid=7). I change the episode with +2 to match the site.

Now I just need to change the season of the specials to zero, and commit the changes.
